# TicTacToe

This application allows the user to play TicTacToe.  The application will prompt the user to sign up, but this can be skipped with the 'already have an account?' button. On the sign in page the user will put the same username and password they used to sign up.  Once the user is signed in, the user can click start game and begin playing.  The user will start playing as X and then switch to O.  Upon a winning condition the user will not be able to use the board until the user clicks start game again.  If there is a tie the user will not be able to use the board unless they start a new game.
